# Staycation/Vacation

## Deployed on: https://claudiojsaillant.github.io/Staycation/

## What's this used for?
This app is used to help people find things to do and places to go, near or far.
No matter if you only have one day or twenty days off, everyone deserves a chance to get out and enjoy themselves.
The home page just has general information, links to the other pages, and a log in/sign up modal.
On the Staycation page, you can search through a list of categories to bring up nearby places and events based on your location.
You can also set and view your favorites as well as view some popular spots.
On the Vacation page, you can click to find airline tickets and hotels.
In future releases, we plan on expanding the APIs used to stay in the app to find flights, hotels, rental cars, and more.
